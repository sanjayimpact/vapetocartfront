                What Are Disposable Vapes?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-3">
                A disposable vape is some sort of little stick that comes
                already filled and charged for use just one time. It is not like
                the refillable vape kit with its coil changing, e-liquid
                refilling, and battery charging but can be finished quickly by
                the smoker using it. Once the e-liquid runs out or the battery
                does not function anymore, it is to be thrown out or disposed
                of.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-3">

                Why Are Disposable Vapes a Game-Changer in 2025?
              </h2>

              <h3 className="mb-3 fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">
                1. Ultimate Convenience
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-3">
                The main benefit of&nbsp;
                <strong>disposable vapes</strong>
                &nbsp;is perhaps the convenience factor. They would suit any
                novice who does not want the effort of keeping a vape kit.
                Unlike a refillable vape, which needs to be refilled almost
                constantly and have its coils replaced, disposables come out of
                the box fully charged and ready to use.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mb-3 fw-bold fs-5 mt-3">
                2. No Maintenance or Setup Required
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-3">
                Traditional vapes would require regular cleaning, changing their
                coils, and recharging batteries. With disposable ones, however,
                all these duties are obsolete. Vapes are thus perfect for people
                who want uncomplicated, hassle-free smoking experiences.

                3. Affordable and Cost-Effective
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-3">
                The majority of vapers would bulk buy vapes to save some money.
                Bulk buying gives users the benefit of saving money compared to
                purchasing individual devices.&nbsp;
                <strong>Disposable vapes</strong>
